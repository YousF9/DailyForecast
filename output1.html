AUSTIN (KXAN) — Following the first 100° high temperature of the year in our area yesterday, in Richland Springs northwest of Austin, milder weather returns today behind an early May cold front.
Austin recorded a 97 degree high temperature yesterday, but we may be 20 degrees cooler this afternoon. The front is expected in the Austin metro area midday today with little more than a brief light shower, but with much more comfortable temperatures behind it and lower humidity.
A second cold front is expected late Friday, with cooler temperatures in the 70s in the forecast on Saturday. This front may again fail to produce much rainfall, but stay tuned for forecast updates as we are in the heart of severe weather season. A first look at Mother’s Day on Sunday looks gorgeous with warm sunshine returning.
Though we do not have any severe weather threats in our foreseeable future, the month of May has a history of bringing dangerous storms, flooding and tornadoes. Stay with the First Warning Weather team through storm season.
